    <description>
        BOM, also called Bill of Materials. It bundles several dependencies to assure
        that the versions will work together.

        This bom module is inspired by the spring-boot project.
        All dependencies, plugins and properties should be defined here in order
        to make the parent pom clean.

        Although this would make the project's architecture more complex,
        the consistence of dependencies management is hard to reject.

        Notion to the maintainer: any versions or dependencies should be defined here,
        the child module shouldn't have any version labeled dependency.
